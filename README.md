## Usage

Keep App.java and Snowflake.java in the same folder, compile both files then run App.java.
A program will launch, displaying a Koch Snowflake and a slider at the bottom of the screen. The user may pick what order of Snowflake they wish to view by dragging the slider to the corresponding number. The window is resizable and the snowflake will resize itself alongside the window in order to remain clearly displayed at all times.
