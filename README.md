# Koch Snowflake

## Description

This application is used to display the first 11 orders of a Koch snowflake pattern. The most challenging aspect of this project was finding the correct algorithm to display a recursive pattern. 
When you run the application the user may adjust the slider at the bottom of the screen to choose which order they would like to display. Around the 9th order you stop seeing visible changes, and past the 11th order the time for the recursive algorithm to complete compromises user experience.

## Usage

Keep App.java and Snowflake.java in the same folder, compile both files then run App.java.
A program will launch, displaying a Koch Snowflake and a slider at the bottom of the screen. The user may pick what order of Snowflake they wish to view by dragging the slider to the corresponding number. The window is resizable and the snowflake will resize itself alongside the window in order to remain clearly displayed at all times.
